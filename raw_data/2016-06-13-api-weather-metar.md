Query METAR weather observations. METARs (Meterological Terminal Air Reports) are a frequently updated (every hour or more) form of surface weather data.

METAR data is only stored for recent dates (e.g. the last 2-3 days) for which there is not yet an hourly QCLCD (quality-controlled) observation. If METARs are unavailable for a range of recent dates, check the [hourly weather API](http://localhost:5001/api-docs#collapse-api-weather-hourly).


### Query Parameters

All query parameters are optional
